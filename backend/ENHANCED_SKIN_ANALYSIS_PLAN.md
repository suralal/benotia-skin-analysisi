- **Personalized Goals**: Set realistic improvement targets

#### "One Surprising Insight" Feature
- **Implementation**: AI-powered unique skin observations
- **Examples**:
  - "Your left cheek shows 23% more sun damage than your right"
  - "Your skin texture suggests you're a side sleeper"
  - "Your pore pattern indicates optimal hydration in T-zone"
  - "Early signs suggest you'll develop fine lines in forehead first"

#### Personalized Recommendations
- **Treatment Plans**: Customized skincare routines
- **Lifestyle Tips**: Sleep position, sun exposure, diet recommendations
- **Product Suggestions**: Targeted product recommendations
